Hey! I’m Leonel — an economist diving deep into data, using machine learning to make sense of the economic world.

While I’m not planning to leave economics behind (I actually like it too much), I’ve been building a personal portfolio focused on predictive models applied to economic and environmental data — especially using Python, scikit-learn, and neural networks when it makes sense. You can expect upcoming projects around forecasting, energy, emissions, and real-world economic indicators.

    🧰 Tools I use: Python · Pandas · Scikit-learn · Keras · SQL · Jupyter · Matplotlib · Optuna

    🔍 Interests: Machine Learning for Economics, Environmental Impact, Model Interpretability, Policy-Driven Data

    📊 Recent work: Final project in a Data Science bootcamp — predicting electric energy consumption and CO₂ emissions for EU vehicles using ML and deep learning models. Check it out here:

    🌍 I’m based in Germany, originally from Brazil. I speak 🇧🇷 Portuguese, 🇬🇧 English, and 🇩🇪 German.

    ⚙️ Coming soon: more structured economic modeling + a Streamlit app that actually works.

Let’s make data meaningful — and a bit beautiful too.
