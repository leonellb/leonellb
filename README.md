Hey! Iâ€™m Leonel â€” an economist diving deep into data, using machine learning to make sense of the economic world.

Between January and April 2025, I completed an intensive Data Science Bootcamp through DataScientest in partnership with UniversitÃ© Paris 1 PanthÃ©on-Sorbonne. The program consisted of 280 hours of technical instruction and 120 hours dedicated to the development of an applied final project.

As the culmination of this training, I worked on a real-world predictive modeling challenge focused on environmental and energy indicators in the European automotive sector. The project involved preprocessing open datasets from the European Environment Agency, building and comparing traditional machine learning models and deep learning networks, and analyzing the electric energy consumption and COâ‚‚ emissions of vehicles across the EU. You can explore the full project here:

This is just the beginning. My goal is to develop a growing portfolio of machine learning models tailored to the field of economics â€” using data to anticipate, interpret, and visualize patterns in markets, policies, and behavior.

### Why Iâ€™m not planning to leave economics behind

I actually like it too much. My approach is not about switching careers, but about expanding the tools of economic analysis. Iâ€™m interested in combining statistical thinking, causal inference, and machine learning in order to better understand â€” and sometimes predict â€” how economic systems behave in complex, real-world settings.

### Iâ€™m based in Germany

Originally from Brazil. I speak ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· Portuguese, ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª German, and ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ English fluently â€” and I can also work with written ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ Spanish, though spoken communication might drift into PortuÃ±ol.

### Coming soon

More structured economic modeling and interpretability-focused experiments.  
Also: the Streamlit app that was supposed to be ready... will actually work.
